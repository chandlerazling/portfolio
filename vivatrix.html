      <h1> Overview </h1>
      <p>Vivatrix is a project I took on to practice branding, UI design, and front end development. It is a simple landing page that showcases the product.</p>

      <h1>Wireframes</h1>
      <p>After doing some research and analysis of other landing pages that advertise supplements, I wireframed two versions of the site. The main elements I wanted to include were an overview of the product, the results it has, an explanation of how it works, and testimonials. After getting feedback, I decided that the second version would give a better introduction to the product.</p>

    <h1>Branding</h1>
    <p>For the logo, I sketched out designs that and then created them in sketch. I settled on a design that was in the middle of my variations as it had a nice balance between sharp edges and curves. </p>

    <p>I went through different variations of the brand name and decided on Vivatrix. I chose green for its associations with cleanliness, nature, and energy. </p>

    <h1>Styling</h1>
    <p>I decided on an analogous color scheme as I felt that the cool colors created a sense of healing and revitalization. For the font, I chose Nanum Gothic since it is a clean and modern font. </p>

    <h1>Mockup</h1>
    <p>For the most part, implementing the style and creating the mockup was a smooth process. I separated sections by background color, switching between white and combinations of the color scheme. The section that went through the most changes was the testimonials section. Originally, I had white text on the green background, which was difficult to read unless it was bold. I tried out different versions of white backgrounds for the individual testimonials and in my final design I separated the testimonial from the user into a white speech bubble. </p>

      <h1>Development</h1>
      <p>I developed a responsive page using HTML, CSS, and JQuery. I also experimented with motion design using the Velocity framework. I tried out different animations for elements as they come into view when scrolling. In addition, I used canvases for the "How It Works" section to animate the lines going between the different stages.</p>

     <div class="case-study-container">
    <h1>Conclusion</h1>
    <p>This project was a good exercise for both design and development and I learned a lot. I think that overall my design works, but I could go through more iterations of the motion design. If I had more time, I would definitely work on the animations more as there are so many subtleties to motion design. There is still a lot more to learn about timing and easing, and how changing those affects the user experience. </p>
