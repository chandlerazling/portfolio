      <h1> Overview </h1>
      <p>As easy as it is to buy fast food, there are a lot of frustrations that Iâ€™ve experienced with it. Figuring out my order in the drive through can be stressful, sometimes my order gets messed up, and going to a restaurant only to find that the drive through line extends out the parking lot is the worst. I think a lot of these problems could easily be solved with an app, so I designed one. </p>

    <div class="case-study-container">
      <h1>User Research</h1>
      <h2>What is your biggest challenge with ordering fast food?</h2>
      <div id="piechart1"></div>
      <p>This result was much different than my expectation. I thought answers would be varied and if anything more focused on the actual ordering process. </p>
      <h2> What would make the ordering process easier?</h2>
      <div id="piechart2"></div>
      <p>Users who wanted easier communication mentioned communication with server, issues with speakers, and getting other people's orders. Those who said improved menus wanted menus with pictures and simpler menus. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="case-study-container">
      <h1>User Stories</h1>
      <p>Referencing my research, I gathered user stories that would become the core of this app. </p>
      <p>As a user, I want to view restaurants near me or a location I input.<br/>
      As a user, I want to select a restaurant, see details, and view a menu.<br/>
      As a user, I want to select items and purchase them using my phone.<br/>
      As a user, I want to customize an item I select to my liking.<br/>
      As a user, I want to rate and review a restaurant.<br/>
      As a user, I want to create an account.<br/>
      As a user, I want to view my transactions.<br/>
